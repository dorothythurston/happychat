# HappyChat
Chat simulation app that takes select user inputs and supplies optimistic
computer generated responses.

Things I worked on while making this app:
- Local Notifications
- Customizing UITableView
- Dynamic user interface elements including UITableViewCells
- Customizing standard IB elements such as UIButton and UITextView
- Implementing delegate patterns
- Moving the view to the appropriate height when UIKeyboard is present or
  changes type
